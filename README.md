# CSS Legit Autostrafer
A cheat designed for Counter-Strike: Source that helps you strafe by pressing keys with a very small delay when you strafe.

### Is this undetected on bunnyhop anti-cheats?
As far as I know, yes. I have tested this on BASH 2.0 servers and never got autobanned.

## I can't compile this? Why?
This is not ready-to-compile and is only more of a proof of concept, the strafer isn't 100% sync either due to delay. This is possible to integrate into a CS:S cheat if you have your own code and truly wish to but if you're nice enough please give some credit :-)

I will potentially release a compiled version of the strafer later on this repository.

Note: This project is portable to other games too due to its simplicity! You could try it out on other movement game/gamemodes and see if it works.
